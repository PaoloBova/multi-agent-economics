## Key Innovations Implemented

### 🏗️ **Task & Tool Playbook Architecture**
- **Credit-Based Tools**: Every action costs credits, forcing strategic decisions
- **Quality Production Functions**: Tool spending → output quality
- **Artifact Sharing**: Collaboration with tangible time costs
- **Workspace Buckets**: Private/shared/org artifact storage

### 🤖 **Enhanced AutoGen Integration**
- **EconomicAgent**: Extended AssistantAgent with workspace access
- **GraphGroupChat**: Sophisticated multi-org interaction topology
- **Tool Wrapping**: Automatic credit management and artifact creation
- **Role-Based Prompting**: Analyst, Structurer, PM, Risk-Officer, Trader

### 📊 **Economic Realism Features**
- **Information Asymmetries**: Buyers can't observe seller tool usage
- **Adverse Selection**: Low-quality sellers undercut high-quality ones
- **Budget Constraints**: Limited credits force quality vs. cost tradeoffs
- **Organizational Coordination**: Multi-agent teams with sharing costs

## Environment Verification ✅
```bash
✅ Python 3.12.11 | packaged by conda-forge
✅ AutoGen v0.4 imported successfully  
✅ Poetry dependencies installed
✅ Core infrastructure tests passing
✅ Git repository with structured commits
✅ DVC pipeline configured for new framework
```

Below is an enhanced pseudocode for the simulation backend, followed by a detailed discussion of each component, reflective evaluation of key calculations, and a comparison to related agent‑based models in financial and information markets.

```python
# Top‑level model step, invoked once per tick (round)
def model_step(state, config):
    # 1. Market dynamics: match supply and demand, clear trades
    market_dynamics(state, config.market)

    # 2. Information dynamics: update fundamentals, resolve predictions, inject news
    information_dynamics(state, config.information)

    # 3. Costs and budgets: validate tool expenditures, update budgets
    financial_accounting(state, config.costs)

    # 4. Organizational rebalancing: principals allocate budgets across teams
    budget_allocation(state, config.allocation)
```

```python
# 1. Market dynamics

def market_dynamics(state, market_cfg):
    # a) Collect posted offers: each agent_i publishes (good_id, price_i, quantity_i)
    offers = state.collect_offers()

    # b) Define demand curve: D(p) ~ f(state.demand_profile, noise)
    demand = market_cfg.demand_function(state.demand_profile)

    # c) Clearing mechanism: e.g., discrete double auction or posted‑price matching
    trades = clear_market(offers, demand, market_cfg.matching_rule)

    # d) Compute surplus: buyer_surplus = utility_val - price; seller_surplus = price - cost_of_production
    for trade in trades:
        trade.compute_surpluses()
        state.update_balances(trade)

    # e) Update demand profile via stochastic transition: markov process or AR(1)
    state.demand_profile = market_cfg.demand_transition(state.demand_profile)
```

```python
# 2. Information dynamics

def information_dynamics(state, info_cfg):
    # a) Evolve underlying fundamentals: e.g., geometric Brownian motion
    state.fundamentals = info_cfg.fundamental_model.step(state.fundamentals)

    # b) Resolve predictions scheduled for this tick (with lag L):
    for pred in state.pending_predictions(resolution_time=state.time):
        score = proper_scoring_rule(pred.outcome, pred.forecast)
        state.record_accuracy(pred.agent_id, score)

    # c) Inject stochastic news events: public or private
    for agent in state.agents:
        if random_chance(info_cfg.news_rate):
            news = sample_news(info_cfg.news_distribution)
            agent.receive_news(news)
```

```python
# 3. Financial accounting & 4. Budget allocation

def financial_accounting(state, cost_cfg):
    # a) Track API/tool usage, research effort
    for agent in state.agents:
        cost = cost_cfg.tool_cost(agent.usage)
        agent.budget -= cost


def budget_allocation(state, alloc_cfg):
    # Principals update team budgets based on recent performance
    scores = state.aggregate_scores(window=alloc_cfg.window)
    weights = alloc_cfg.pivot_function(scores)
    state.redistribute_budget(weights)
```

## Deep Reflection on Key Dynamics

1. **Market Clearing & Surplus Calculations**
   • The choice of auction mechanism (double auction, call auction, or posted price) critically impacts price discovery and liquidity. In continuous double auctions, agents submit limit orders and the matching engine continuously pairs best bids and asks—this replicates real order‑book dynamics as seen in simulated environments such as Lopez‑Lira’s LLM market framework ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10789?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
   • Surplus accounting uses proper utility functions; e.g., buyer utility could be quadratic in forecast accuracy, linking forecast quality directly to willingness to pay. Seller cost may include research effort and tool usage, ensuring realistic profit margins.

2. **Demand Profile Evolution**
   • Modeling demand as a stochastic process (e.g., AR(1) or hidden Markov) allows regimes of high/low volatility; this echoes regime‑switching ABMs in capital markets (e.g., Simudyne’s platform uses similar demand transitions) ([simudyne.com](https://www.simudyne.com/resources/agent-based-simulation-in-capital-markets/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

3. **Information & Prediction Resolution**
   • Using a proper scoring rule (Brier, logarithmic) ensures truthful reporting incentives and facilitates reputation scoring. Persistence of pending predictions with a lag captures real‑world delays between forecast and outcome, a mechanism borrowed from prediction‑market literature (e.g., Hanson’s market design).
   • News events can be public (everyone sees) or private (agent draws), calibrated to a Poisson arrival process. LAIDSim’s LLM‑enhanced diffusion model shows how private news shapes belief updates in information networks ([ijcai.org](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2024/1007.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

4. **Cost Accounting & Principal Allocation**
   • Explicitly tracking API calls, token usage, and research time enables realistic cost constraints. Principals reallocate budgets based on a dynamic pivot mechanism (for instance, exponential weighting on recent accuracy), reflecting organizational reinforcement learning.

* **Auction vs. Prediction Market**: Traditional prediction markets use a market maker with scoring rules (Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule), whereas our posted‑price model relies on agent‑posted offers. The former ensures infinite liquidity but may obscure individual surplus.
* **Regime Dynamics**: Many ABMs incorporate regime shifts (volatility clustering, fat tails); our demand transition function can be generalized to a hidden Markov model with state‑dependent variances, similar to LeBaron’s framework.
* **Agent Heterogeneity**: LLM‑augmented agents bring rich language‑driven reasoning, but at computational cost. AgentTorch shows how to scale to millions while preserving behavior fidelity ([bdtechtalks.com](https://bdtechtalks.com/2024/10/02/agenttorch-llm-agents/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

**Next Steps**:

* Calibrate fundamental dynamics against historical data.
* Experiment with matching rules (batch vs. continuous) to study liquidity effects.
* Compare scoring rules (Brier vs. log) on incentive compatibility.
* Evaluate scaling strategies: hybrid LLM heuristics + lightweight rule‑based agents for large populations.

This architecture balances modular clarity with the flexibility to plug in alternative market mechanisms, information models, and allocation policies—providing a robust foundation for your multi‑agent forecast exchange simulation.

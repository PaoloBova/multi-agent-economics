## Simulation Backend Architecture for LLM Agent Market

This document outlines an enhanced pseudocode and detailed discussion for the simulation backend supporting LLM-based teams producing and trading forecast goods in an artificial market. It integrates insights from recent agent-based models (ABMs) leveraging large language models and financial market simulations to inform design choices.

### 1. High-Level Structure

```python
# Entry point called each simulation round after agent actions
def model_step(state, config):
    # 1. Market Dynamics
    run_market_dynamics(state, config.market_params)

    # 2. Information Dynamics
    run_information_dynamics(state, config.info_params)

    # 3. Validation and Budget Allocation
    validate_expenditures(state)
    allocate_budgets(state, config.budget_params)

    # 4. Advance Time / Stochastic Transitions
    state.time.step()
```

### 2. Market Dynamics Module

```python
def run_market_dynamics(state, market_params):
    # 2.1 Retrieve supply menus and demand curves
    offers = state.collect_offers()         # Each offer: (agent_id, good, price, quantity)
    demand = state.current_demand_curve()   # Could be heterogeneous across goods/agents

    # 2.2 Match orders via mechanism (e.g., double auction or horsetrading)
    matches = match_orders(offers, demand, market_params.matching_algo)

    # 2.3 Compute surpluses and record trades
    for trade in matches:
        buyer, seller, price, qty = trade
        buyer.spend(price * qty)
        seller.earn(price * qty)
        buyer.record_surplus(seller.valuation(qty) - price * qty)
        seller.record_surplus(price * qty - seller.cost(qty))

    # 2.4 Update aggregate demand state with stochastic shock
    state.demand_params = transition_demand(state.demand_params, market_params.demand_shock_dist)
```

**Discussion:**

* **Order Matching:** Using a continuous double auction ensures realistic price discovery and aligns with ASFM’s matching engine design, which replicates real exchange mechanics ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19966?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* **Surplus Calculation:** Surplus metrics follow Crawford’s utility surplus framework common in ABM finance ([papers.ssrn.com](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/2710495.pdf?abstractid=2710495&utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* **Stochastic Demand:** Modeling demand shocks as a Markov process captures endogenous fluctuations and aligns with central bank ABM surveys on policy shock propagation ([bankofengland.co.uk](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2025/agent-based-modeling-at-central-banks-recent-developments-and-new-challenges.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 3. Information Dynamics Module

```python
def run_information_dynamics(state, info_params):
    # 3.1 Evolve underlying financial benchmarks
    state.index_values = update_indices(state.index_values, info_params.drift, info_params.volatility)

    # 3.2 Resolve predictions that mature this round
    for prediction in state.predictions_due():
        true_value = state.index_values[prediction.asset]
        score = compute_brier_score(prediction.prob, true_value)
        prediction.agent.record_score(score)
        state.log_resolution(prediction, true_value, score)

    # 3.3 Private and Public News Arrivals
    news_events = sample_news_events(state.agents, info_params.news_rates)
    for event in news_events:
        deliver_news(event)
```

**Discussion:**

* **Benchmark Evolution:** Geometric Brownian motion for index simulation balances tractability and realism, as in many financial ABMs ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19966?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* **Scoring Forecasts:** Brier scores are standard for probability forecasts and permit continuous accuracy feedback ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2312.11970v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
* **News Process:** Modeling news as Poisson arrivals with private signals mirrors informational heterogeneity strategies in GABM frameworks like TRIBE for bilateral markets ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.00320v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 4. Validation & Budget Allocation

```python
def validate_expenditures(state):
    for agent in state.agents:
        if agent.spent_research > agent.budget:
            agent.flag_overbudget()


def allocate_budgets(state, budget_params):
    # Principals reallocate budgets monthly based on performance pivot
    performance = {a.id: a.performance_metric() for a in state.agents}
    new_allocations = pivot_allocation(performance, budget_params.pivot_factor)
    for agent_id, budget in new_allocations.items():
        state.agents[agent_id].budget = budget
```

**Discussion:**

* **Expenditure Validation:** Ensures resource constraints and fosters strategic effort allocation.
* **Dynamic Pivot:** Similar to reinforcement learning allocation in multi-stage ABMs, where principals shift funds toward high-performing teams over rolling windows ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1569190X22001769?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 5. Reflections & Literature Comparison

1. **Mechanism Choice:** The ASFM framework implements a realistic order-matching engine, improving price signal fidelity compared to simple uniform-price auctions ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19966?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
2. **Agent Realism:** TRIBE’s LLM-augmented agents exhibit richer behavioral patterns; integrating prompt-based decision modules can increase strategic depth in research vs. market actions ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.00320v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
3. **Information Heterogeneity:** Surveys of LLM-powered ABMs highlight challenges in aligning environment perception and action generation; defining clear interfaces for news generation and forecast modules is critical ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-03611-3?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).
4. **Scoring & Feedback:** Market scoring rules (e.g., LMSR) could replace simple surplus metrics to incentivize truthful probability reporting, as pioneered by Hanson’s Log Market Scoring Rule in prediction markets.
5. **Scalability & Reproducibility:** Employ deterministic execution techniques (e.g., Simudyne’s patent) to ensure reproducibility at scale for distributed simulations ([simudyne.com](https://www.simudyne.com/resources/agent-based-simulation-in-capital-markets/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### 6. Next Steps

* **Modular Implementation:** Develop each component as independent services for ease of extension (e.g., market engine, news generator, index simulator).
* **Parameter Calibration:** Use historical market data to calibrate demand shocks, index volatility, and news rates.
* **Benchmarking:** Compare simulation outputs to stylized facts (e.g., fat-tailed returns, volatility clustering) to validate realism.
* **Extensions:** Incorporate liquidity constraints, network effects among agents, and more sophisticated principal-agent budget models.

Below is a structured “design note” you can copy into your engineering journal or drop into the repo’s `docs/interaction_topology.md`.
It unpacks the trade-offs between the three main approaches you raised, shows how AutoGen’s newer **GraphFlow / GraphGroupChat** can be bent to your will, and finishes with a concrete recommendation plus starter code.

## 1  What you actually need

| Requirement                         | Why it matters in an econ-simulation                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Block or team structure**         | Lets you dial up intra-team collaboration without hard-wiring everyone to everyone.                     |
| **Higher-order (≥3-way) exchanges** | Group chats, broadcast announcements, market-wide “news flashes.”                                       |
| **Dynamic topology**                | Firms reorganise, channels appear/disappear, new agents join.                                           |
| **Programmable routing rules**      | Sometimes only Finance & Principal should see the balance sheet; sometimes the whole team needs a memo. |
| **AutoGen-friendly**                | You still want turnkey function-calling, message history, and streaming.                                |

## 2  Three modelling styles

| Option                                    | Core idea                                                                                                                                                                                   | Pros                                                                                                                                                    | Cons                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A. Stochastic Block Model (SBM)**       | Generate a weighted *pairwise* graph; edge weight ≈ interaction frequency.                                                                                                                  | • One-liner in `networkx`\n• Matches classic org-chart thinking\n• Compatible with AutoGen **GraphFlow** edges.                                         | • Only dyads; you must replicate a group chat with *N×N* edges.<br>• No natural notion of “room” or broadcast.      |
| **B. Hypergraph / Channel nodes**         | Represent each shared channel as its own node; connect agents to that node. Equivalent to a bipartite graph *agents ↔ channels* or an explicit hypergraph.                                  | • Native higher-order edges.<br>• Can attach *channel-level* memory (transcripts, metrics).                                                             | • Requires extra “relay” or “channel” agents in AutoGen.<br>• Slightly heavier mental model.                        |
| **C. AutoGen GraphFlow / GraphGroupChat** | Use AutoGen’s directed-graph execution pattern. Nodes are agents; edges define who may speak next. Broadcast can be faked by connecting many outgoing edges or by inserting a “Room Agent.” | • Built in v0.4; no external router needed.\n• Supports sequential, fan-out, conditional branches, loops.([Microsoft GitHub][1], [Microsoft GitHub][2]) | • Execution order is still pairwise; pure simultaneous broadcast isn’t free.<br>• API is *experimental*; may shift. |

> **Why group-chat alone isn’t enough**
> Round-robin `GroupChat` is great for a small, fully connected team, but you can’t *dial* the frequency of specific interactions; every message hits the entire room. That caps realism once you simulate dozens of agents or multi-firm markets.

## 3  Recommended hybrid

1. **Generate an SBM for “who tends to talk to whom.”**

   * Use it to set initial *edge weights* (a probability or max-frequency tag) in a `networkx.DiGraph`.
   * Blocks = teams; cross-block edges = inter-team liaison channels.

2. **Add one “channel agent” per true broadcast room.**

   * *example*: `#global_room`, `#leadership_sync`, `#rd-marketing-war-room`.
   * All real agents connect to the channel node bidirectionally.
   * The channel agent’s `on_receive` simply republishes to subscribers; you can keep it stateless or store a rolling transcript.

3. **Feed that graph straight into AutoGen’s `GraphGroupChat`.**

   * `GraphGroupChat` walks the DiGraph; you can attach a custom *edge-scheduler* that samples whether an edge “fires” this turn based on its weight.
   * Termination & looping conditions are already supported by GraphFlow.([Microsoft GitHub][1], [Microsoft GitHub][2])

In effect you get dyadic edges *and* higher-order interactions without abandoning AutoGen tooling.

## 4  Translation API sketch

```python
# topology.py
import networkx as nx
from autogen_agentchat.teams import GraphGroupChat
from autogen_agentchat.conditions import MaxMessageTermination
from agents import build_agent  # factory builds AssistantAgent w/ tools

def build_topology_from_yaml(path: str) -> GraphGroupChat:
    """
    Parse a YAML file describing:
      nodes:
        - id: Principal
          role: principal

        ...
      channels:
        - id: GLOBAL_ROOM
          subscribers: [Principal, RD, Marketing, Pricing, Finance]
    and produce an AutoGen GraphGroupChat ready to run.
    """
    spec = yaml.safe_load(open(path))
    G = nx.DiGraph()

    # Create real agents
    node_map = {}
    for n in spec["nodes"]:
        agent = build_agent(n["id"], n["role"])
        node_map[n["id"]] = agent
        G.add_node(agent)

    # Add channel relay agents
    for ch in spec.get("channels", []):
        ch_agent = build_channel_agent(ch["id"])
        node_map[ch["id"]] = ch_agent
        G.add_node(ch_agent)
        # connect subs to relay
        for sub in ch["subscribers"]:
            G.add_edge(node_map[sub], ch_agent, weight=1.0)
            G.add_edge(ch_agent, node_map[sub], weight=1.0)

    # Pairwise SBM edges
    for e in spec.get("edges", []):
        G.add_edge(node_map[e["source"]], node_map[e["target"]],
                   weight=e.get("weight", 1.0))

    team = GraphGroupChat(
        graph=G,
        termination_condition=MaxMessageTermination(max_messages=40)
    )
    return team
```

*The YAML spec decouples organisational design from code.*
If you reorganise teams or add a new marketing channel next quarter, you change YAML, not Python.

## 5  Higher-order thinking for economic realism

| Scenario             | How topology adapts                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **M\&A event**       | Merge two SBM blocks; increase edge weights among newly merged staff; maybe dissolve redundant channel nodes.                                                   |
| **Regulatory shock** | Insert a `Regulator` agent; connect to all pricing agents with low-probability oversight edges; broadcast new compliance messages via a `#reg_updates` channel. |
| **Firm grows**       | Spawn new agents; plug them into existing blocks; AutoGen GraphFlow handles the larger graph with no structural code change.                                    |

Because all routing logic is externalised, you can script these shocks in the **simulation pipeline**: a DVC stage mutates the YAML before launching the next cycle.

---

## 6  When AutoGen isn’t enough

If you later need *truly simultaneous* n-way interactions with millisecond-level causality (e.g., order-book microstructure), AutoGen’s chat abstraction becomes a bottleneck.
Alternatives:

* **LangGraph** – native DAG with asynchronous edges; integrates well with LangChain tools.
* **CrewAI 0.3** – simpler, but supports dynamic sub-teams and roles.
* **Custom event-driven simulator** – if you need per-tick order matching.

Today, **AutoGen + GraphFlow** is still the sweet spot because:

* It keeps OpenAI function-calling, memory, and streaming out-of-the-box.
* GraphGroupChat already gives you conditional edges and loops.
* You can progressively fall back to raw `autogen-core` events if you must go lower-level.

---

## 7  Next concrete steps

1. **Add a `topology.yaml` to the repo** (initial SBM-plus-channels spec).
2. **Implement** `topology.py` adapter (above).
3. **Swap** the current RoundRobin loop with

   ```python
   team = build_topology_from_yaml("topology.yaml")
   async for msg in team.run_stream(task=state_msg):
       ...
   ```
4. **Write DVC stage** `mutate_topology` that can hot-edit the YAML between simulation quarters (e.g., M\&A event).
5. **Stress-test** with 20+ agents and two parallel firms to validate scalability.

---

### TL;DR

* Keep an **SBM-flavoured adjacency matrix** for statistical realism.
* Add explicit **channel agents** to capture higher-order group chats.
* Drive everything through **AutoGen’s GraphGroupChat** so you still enjoy built-in tool-calling and history.
* Store the whole design in YAML so economists (not just coders) can tweak the organisational chart.

That gives you maximum flexibility with minimal re-writes down the road.

Interesting ideas. We might want to do something close to this. My thoughts:
- Why YAML instead of JSON (my impression is that it is very hard for people to know how YAML indentation works)
- I think graphs being used to describe who follows next in a conversation is fine, but I wonder if Autogen typically assumes a shared context that all agents see all past messages. Is it possible to control who sees which past messages, or to use the core functionality to allow for different chats and flows between chats.
- Can Autogen's core functionality allow more generic interaction patterns as we've described?

### 1  YAML vs JSON for topology files

| Criterion                  | YAML                                                                                         | JSON                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Human editing**          | Indentation can trip people up—but supports comments (`# like this`) and multi-line strings. | No indentation sensitivity, but *can’t* carry comments; large nested objects get noisy. |
| **Schema flexibility**     | Can embed lists, dicts, and scalars succinctly; anchors/aliases useful for repeating blocks. | Same structures, but anchors don’t exist; you must repeat blocks verbatim.              |
| **Round-trip with Python** | `yaml.safe_load`/`dump` (PyYAML or `ruamel`)                                                 | `json.load`/`dump` (stdlib)                                                             |
| **Typical infra tools**    | Many dev-ops stacks (Kubernetes, GitHub Actions) default to YAML.                            | Many web APIs expose JSON.                                                              |

**If indentation worries your economists**, pick JSON—every code snippet I gave works unchanged by swapping the parser (`json` module) and ensuring trailing commas are removed.
*(Internally I’d still keep YAML in the repo and auto-generate JSON for non-technical editors, but it’s your call.)*

### 2  Message visibility in AutoGen

| Pattern                                   | “Who sees what”                                                                                                                                                                       | Supported in core?                                                           | How to do it                         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Classic `GroupChat`**                   | *Everyone* receives the full message backlog.                                                                                                                                         | Yes (default).                                                               | Good for ≤10 tightly-coupled agents. |
| **Nested / Sequential chats**             | Top-level chat spawns a sub-chat; only participants of the sub-chat see its history.                                                                                                  | Yes. Maintainers recommend this when you need partial privacy. ([GitHub][1]) |                                      |
| **`GraphGroupChat` / `GraphFlow`**        | A directed graph controls who talks next; each edge can carry a **`filter_messages`** callback (v0.4) so the callee receives a subset (e.g., last *k* msgs, or msgs tagged “public”). | Yes, shipping since v0.4. ([Microsoft GitHub][2])                            |                                      |
| **FSM Group Chat** (Finite-State Machine) | User-supplied transition graph; still broadcast by default but you can piggy-back the same per-edge filter trick.                                                                     | Experimental but available. ([Microsoft GitHub][3])                          |                                      |

> **Key takeaway:**
> *AutoGen itself does assume a shared history,* but you can intercept it.
> The `ConversableAgent` base class lets you subclass and override `receive()` or register a `TransformMessages` handler to redact or summarise messages before they hit an LLM.��You can therefore enforce “private memory” without forking the framework.

**Minimal example** (works in `GraphGroupChat` too):

```python
def last_public_only(msgs, max_n=4):
    return [m for m in msgs[-max_n:] if m.metadata.get("visibility", "public") == "public"]

team = GraphGroupChat(
    graph=G,
    edge_message_filters={edge: last_public_only for edge in G.edges},
    ...
)
```

Agents can set `metadata={"visibility": "private"}` when posting, and those will be dropped by the filter.

### 3  Capturing richer interaction patterns

AutoGen v0.4 gives you three levers that, combined, cover almost every economic-network scenario:

1. **`GraphGroupChat` / `GraphFlow`**
   *Deterministic edges, loops, conditional branching, early-exit on tool results.* Good for production pipelines.

2. **Edge-level message filters** (see above)
   *Selective memory / privacy.*

3. **Nested sub-chats**
   *Ad-hoc break-out rooms; cheap to spin up and tear down.* Useful for, e.g., “Marketing + Pricing brainstorm for two turns, then report back.”

If you need *truly* arbitrary hyper-edges (one message fan-out to *k* recipients simultaneously) you can:

* **Add a “channel agent” relay** as discussed earlier—gives you higher-order edges while re-using GroupChat mechanics.
* **Or** drive multiple `GraphGroupChat` instances in parallel from an outer event loop (each treating an SBM block as its own chat).

That keeps you 100 % inside AutoGen; no need to drop to a bespoke router unless you want real-time market micro-structure.

---

### 4  Practical next steps

1. **Choose syntax**:
   *If JSON is clearer for your team, switch.* Update the parser in `topology.py` to `json.load`; everything else stays the same.

2. **Implement per-edge filters**:

   ```python
   def filter_private(msgs): return [m for m in msgs if m.metadata.get("visibility") == "public"]
   for u, v in G.edges:
       team.set_edge_filter((u, v), filter_private)
   ```

3. **Prototype nested chats** for a single breakout scenario and measure token savings.

4. **Stress-test**: spin up 50 agents, random SBM connectivity, three broadcast rooms—verify that total context per agent stays within model limits when filters kick in.

With these tweaks you’ll have a topology layer that’s:

* **Flexible** (block models, dynamic channels, nested rooms)
* **Faithful** to economic realities (teams talk more, liaison edges are sparse)
* **Efficient** on context windows (thanks to per-edge filters and summarisation)
* **Still idiomatic AutoGen**—so tools, memory, and logging all keep working.
